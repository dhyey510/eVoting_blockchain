# Blockchain eVoting Application

Introducing the Blockchain eVoting Application, where cutting-edge blockchain technology meets the cornerstone of democracy. Our platform offers users a secure and transparent space to participate in elections, enabling them to vote for candidates, delegate their voting rights, and access comprehensive election summaries. But we don't stop there â€“ we've introduced a decentralized marketplace for purchasing NFTs representing political parties.

## Features

### Admin Panel

- **Reset Button**: Resets the entire voting process, requiring users to request voting rights again.
- **End Vote**: Stops the current ballot and displays the winner. Prevents further voting.
- **Summary**: Displays the current election status, including candidate list and live vote count.
- **Pause / Continue**: Allows the admin to pause or resume the election process.
- **NFT Management**: Admin can mint and list NFTs representing political parties for sale.

### Voter Interface

- **Voting**: Users can vote for candidates or choose NOTA if they prefer.
- **Give Me Right**: Users must request voting rights from the admin and have sufficient Ethereum balance.
- **Delegate**: Users can delegate their voting rights to others.
- **NFT Marketplace**: Users can buy NFTs representing political parties.
